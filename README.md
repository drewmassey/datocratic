_Data in Politics; Politics in Data_

## What is this?

This is just a repo of various explorations of FEC filing data and other information related to the 2020 Democratic Primary that interest me. I don't update it often, but feel free to drop me a line if anything piques your interest?

I don't include the raw data files in the repo for size considerations but can provide them upon request.
